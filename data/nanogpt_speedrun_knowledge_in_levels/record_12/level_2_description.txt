Here's a detailed analysis of the improvements made:

1. **Attention Window Warmup Implementation**
- Added dynamic attention block size that grows from 64 to 1792 tokens during training
- Modified the attention mask to use this growing window size instead of fixed 1024
- Implemented linear warmup schedule calculated as: 
  `64*((step/total_steps * (1792 - 64) + 64)//64)`
- Added attn_blocksize parameter throughout the model forwarding

2. **Optimizer and Training Adjustments**
- Reduced total iterations from 1875 to 1750 (-6.7%)
- Increased cooldown period from 562 to 640 iterations
- Changed Adam betas from (0.9, 0.95) to (0.8, 0.95) for faster momentum adaptation
- Increased Muon learning rate from 0.04 to 0.05
- Shortened Muon momentum warmup period from 500 to 300 steps
- Removed validation step delay (previously skipped first 10 steps)

3. **Architectural Improvements**
- Simplified FlexAttention compilation by removing explicit mode specification
- Renamed "warmdown" to "cooldown" for clarity in scheduling
- Made attention block size a first-class model parameter

**Benefits and Technical Rationale:**

1. **Progressive Context Learning**
- Allows network to first master local patterns before longer dependencies
- Mimics human learning progression from simple to complex
- Avoids overwhelming model with full context early in training

2. **Optimizer Enhancements**
- Lower beta1 (0.8) makes Adam more responsive to recent gradients
- Increased Muon LR compensates for shorter training schedule
- Extended cooldown prevents abrupt learning rate collapse

3. **Training Efficiency**
- 6.7% fewer iterations with comparable performance
- Earlier validation checks surface issues faster
- Linear block size growth matches model capacity development

**Performance Impact:**

1. +27% Speed Improvement
- Reduced from 5.03 to 4.66 minutes for same loss
- Combines faster convergence with computational optimizations

2. Better Memory Alignment
- Block size quantization (64 steps) improves memory access patterns
- Gradual growth matches CUDA kernel optimizations

3. Stability Enhancements
- Momentum warmup aligns with block size progression
- Cooldown period smoothens final optimization phase

**Technical Challenges Addressed:**

1. Dynamic Attention Integration
- Maintained mask compatibility with FlexAttention
- Solved gradient continuity across block size changes
- Preserved compilation benefits through step-wise quantization

2. Training Schedule Coordination
- Balanced block growth rate with iteration reduction
- Aligned momentum/LR schedules with capacity changes
- Maintained distributed training stability

3. Precision Conservation
- Kept bfloat16 stability despite dynamic masking
- Maintained numerical precision in attention ops
- Preserved gradient quality across window sizes

These changes collectively enable more efficient use of model capacity during training while maintaining numerical stability and hardware utilization. The progressive attention window acts as a form of curriculum learning, matching the model's growing capability to handle longer-range dependencies.
