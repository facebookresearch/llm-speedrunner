# Pseudo Code Changes

### 1. Mixed Precision Casting Layer
Added CastedLinear wrapper that automatically casts weights to input dtype:
```
CLASS CastedLinear INHERITS Linear:
    METHOD forward(x):
        RETURN linear(x, weight.cast_to(x.dtype))  # Ensures weight/input dtype alignment
```
- Impact: Enables safer mixed precision training by maintaining numerical stability
- Used in all attention/MLP projections and output head

### 2. Simplified Forward Pass
Changed GPT forward signature and logic:
```
METHOD forward(idx, target):
    x = compute_embeddings(idx)
    x = process_through_transformer_blocks(x)
    logits = lm_head(x)
    logits = apply_tanh_activation(logits)  # 30*tanh(logits/30)
    loss = cross_entropy(logits, target)
    RETURN loss
```
- Key changes:
  - Removed conditional branching for inference vs training
  - Always compute full sequence logits
  - Simplified return to only loss

### 3. Precision Management Strategy
Modified model initialization:
```
MODEL = GPT().cast_to(bfloat16)
FOR each module IN model:
    IF module IS CastedLinear:
        KEEP IN float32  # Maintain precision for critical layers
```
- Impact: Enables mixed precision while preserving numerical stability

### 4. Training Loop Optimization
Streamlined validation and training steps:
```
PROCEDURE validate():
    FOR validation batches:
        WITH no_grad:
            loss += model(x_val, y_val)  # Simplified single-pass loss

PROCEDURE train():
    FOR training batches:
        loss = model(x, y)  # No explicit autocast context
        backprop(loss)
```
- Removed manual autocast context management
- Unified precision handling through CastedLinear

### 5. Hyperparameter Adjustments
```
NUM_ITERATIONS: 3200 → 3242
WARMDOWN_ITERS: 914 → 926
```
- Impact: Extended training schedule for convergence

### Key Improvements:
1. Safer mixed precision through type-aware linear layers
2. Reduced conditional logic for clearer execution paths
3. Manual precision control replacing autocast for better determinism
4. Unified loss computation pattern across train/val
5. Optimized attention backend selection (CUDNN SDP enabled)

These changes aim to improve numerical stability, reduce computational overhead, and simplify the training loop while maintaining model performance.
