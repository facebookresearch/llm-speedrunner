# Pseudo Code Changes

1. **Rotary Positional Embedding Optimization**
```
CLASS Rotary:
    BEFORE:
        Compute inv_freq during forward pass
        Recompute cos/sin matrices every forward pass
        
    NOW:
        Initialize inv_freq as persistent buffer during construction
        Cache cos/sin matrices until sequence length changes
        Inline rotation calculation directly in forward pass
        
    IMPACT: Reduces redundant computations, improves efficiency for variable length sequences
```

2. **Value Residual Learning System**
```
CLASS GPT:
    ADD NEW COMPONENT:
        vte = Embedding layer for token value residuals (12Ã—n_embd dimensions)
        
    FORWARD FLOW:
        vi = Split vte embeddings into 12 chunks (one per transformer layer)
        Each attention layer blends current value with vi chunk using learnable lambda
        
    IMPACT: Enables persistent value patterns across layers, inspired by neural ODE approaches
```

3. **Simplified Attention Architecture**
```
CLASS CausalSelfAttention:
    BEFORE:
        Complex parameter passing with config object
        Separate RMSNorm calls for Q/K
        External rotary embedding application
        
    NOW:
        Direct dimension/head parameters
        Unified norm() helper function
        Integrated rotary embedding calculation
        
    IMPACT: Reduces parameter passing overhead, improves code maintainability
```

4. **Dynamic Training Infrastructure**
```
TRAINING LOOP:
    ADD DYNAMIC BLOCK SIZE:
        attn_blocksize = 64 * ((step/iterations * 1792) // 64)
        
    GRADIENT ACCUMULATION:
        Use context manager for gradient sync optimization
        Only sync gradients on final accumulation step
        
    IMPACT: Enables progressive attention window scaling and optimized distributed training
```

5. **Memory-Efficient Data Loading**
```
CLASS DistributedDataLoader:
    BEFORE:
        Per-device batch size (B) handling
        Complex buffer management
        
    NOW:
        Simplified sequence-centric loading
        Single sequence per process with length T
        Automatic shard advancement
        
    IMPACT: Reduces memory fragmentation, enables longer context processing
```

6. **Parameter Optimization Strategy**
```
OPTIMIZER SETUP:
    SEPARATE PARAMETER GROUPS:
        Group 1: wte + vte embeddings (lr=0.6)
        Group 2: lm_head weights (lr=0.008)
        Group 3: Transformer params + skip_weights (via Muon optimizer)
        
    IMPACT: Fine-grained control over learning dynamics for different parameter types
```

7. **Architectural Simplifications**
```
GLOBAL CHANGES:
    - Replace repeated RMSNorm calls with norm() helper
    - Remove redundant math backend controls
    - Streamline dimension calculations
    - Simplify batch size assumptions (B=1)
    
    IMPACT: Reduces code complexity while maintaining performance characteristics
