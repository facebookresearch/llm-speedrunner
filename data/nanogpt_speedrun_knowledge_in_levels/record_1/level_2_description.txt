Here's a detailed breakdown of the improvements:

1. **Architectural Improvements**
- **Rotary Positional Embeddings**: Replaced standard positional embeddings with rotary embeddings
  - Added `Rotary` module and `apply_rotary_emb` function for relative position encoding
  - Benefits: Better captures relative positions and attention patterns, improves model accuracy
  - Implementation: Applied to queries/keys in attention instead of separate positional embeddings

- **Simplified Normalization**
  - Removed all affine parameters from RMSNorm implementation
  - Benefits: Reduces parameter count while maintaining effectiveness
  - Tradeoff: Minor performance cost offset by other optimizations

2. **Optimization Improvements**
- **Learning Rate Changes**:
  - Increased base LR from 0.0015 to 0.0018 (3x increase as per changelog)
  - Changed schedule to trapezoidal (warmup → constant → warmdown)
  - Benefits: Following [2405.18392], allows more stable high-LR training

- **Gradient Normalization**:
  - Replaced gradient clipping with per-parameter gradient norm scaling
  - `p.grad = p.grad / (p.grad.norm() + 1e-6)`
  - Benefits: More stable training with high LR, prevents explosion

3. **Initialization/Scaling Changes**
- **Attention Scaling**:
  - Introduced `attn_scale = 1/sqrt(2*n_layer)`
  - Replaced ad-hoc `/ math.sqrt(24)` with systematic layer-based scaling
  - Benefits: Better coordinates residual branches across layers

- **Removed Positional Embeddings**:
  - Deleted `wpe` embedding layer completely
  - Benefits: Parameter reduction + rotary handles position information

4. **Training Process Improvements**
- **Checkpointing**:
  - Added periodic model saving (`save_every` parameter)
  - Benefits: Fault tolerance and easier resumption

- **Batch Size Optimization**:
  - Increased batch size from 32 to 64 tokens
  - Total batch size from 262K to 524K tokens
  - Benefits: Better hardware utilization

5. **Code Simplifications**
- Removed `_init_weights` and special initialization flags
- Eliminated position embedding mixing (`tok_emb + pos_emb`)
- Removed unused configuration options and legacy code paths

**Technical Challenges Addressed**:
1. **Stability at High Learning Rates**: Through gradient normalization and careful attention scaling
2. **Position Encoding Migration**: Non-trivial transition from absolute to relative (rotary) positioning
3. **Distributed Training Coordination**: Maintained DDP compatibility through architectural changes
4. **Learning Rate Schedule Tuning**: Required careful warmup/warmdown balancing for trapezoidal schedule

**Performance Impact**:
Combined these changes enable 2x faster training convergence by:
- Allowing more aggressive learning rates through better normalization
- Improving parameter efficiency with rotary embeddings
- Increasing useful batch size through stability improvements
- Reducing computational overhead from simplified operations

The architectural simplifications also make the model more amenable to compiler optimizations (like torch.compile), while the training process improvements enable better utilization of distributed hardware.
