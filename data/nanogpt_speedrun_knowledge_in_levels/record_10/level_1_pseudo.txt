# Pseudo Code Changes

// 1. Modified Matrix Inversion Algorithm (Newton-Schulz iteration)
FUNCTION zeropower_via_newtonschulz5:
    INPUT: Matrix G, steps
    INITIALIZE X based on G dimensions
    FOR each iteration step:
        COMPUTE A = X * X^T
        // Key Change: Optimized polynomial coefficients and matrix operations
        COMPUTE B = b*A + c*A^2  // Reduced computational complexity
        UPDATE X = a*X + B*X     // Improved convergence properties
    RETURN processed X

// 2. U-Net Architecture with Learned Skip Connections
CLASS GPT IMPLEMENTS NEURAL NETWORK:
    STRUCTURE:
        - Split transformer layers into encoder/decoder
        - Add learnable skip connection weights
        
    FORWARD PASS:
        PROCESS input through encoder layers:
            STORE encoder outputs in skip_connections
        PROCESS through decoder layers:
            COMBINE current activation with weighted skip connection:
                x = x + skip_weights[i] * skip_connections.pop()
        FINAL normalization and output

// 3. Optimizer Configuration Changes
SETUP OPTIMIZATION:
    INCREASE learning rates by 2-4x for:
        - Token embeddings (0.3 ➔ 0.6)
        - Output layer (0.002 ➔ 0.008)
        - Matrix params (0.02 ➔ 0.04)
    ADD skip_weights to scalar parameters
    USE separate optimizers for different parameter types

// 4. Training Schedule Adjustment
SET TRAINING LENGTH:
    REDUCE total iterations: 3242 ➔ 3000
    ADJUST warmdown phase: 926 ➔ 900 steps

Key Improvements:
1. Matrix inversion stability and efficiency through optimized polynomial iteration
2. U-Net architecture enables better gradient flow and feature reuse via learned skips
3. Tuned optimizer settings accommodate new architecture components
4. Streamlined training schedule for faster convergence

Impact:
- UNet skip connections should improve contextual feature preservation
- Modified matrix inversion reduces computational complexity while maintaining numerical stability
- Higher learning rates suggest improved training stability from architecture changes
- Reduced iteration count implies more efficient training process
