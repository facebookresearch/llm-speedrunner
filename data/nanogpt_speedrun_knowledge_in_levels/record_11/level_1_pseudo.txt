# Pseudo Code Changes

1. Enhanced Attention Mechanism:
```python
# Replace standard attention with flexible block attention
def flex_attention(q, k, v, block_mask):
    """
    Utilizes blocked sparse attention pattern with:
    - Causal masking (only attend to previous tokens)
    - Document boundary masking (only attend within same document)
    - Sliding window (1024 token context window)
    """
    return optimized_attention(q, k, v, block_mask)

# Generate attention mask with multiple constraints
def create_block_mask(seq_len):
    mask = causal_mask & document_mask & window_mask
    return blocked_sparse_pattern(mask)
```

2. UNet-style Architecture Modifications:
```python
class GPT:
    def __init__(self):
        # Split transformer into encoder/decoder with learned skip weights
        self.encoder_layers = first_half(transformer_blocks)
        self.decoder_layers = second_half(transformer_blocks)
        self.skip_weights = learnable_parameters(decoder_layers)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Encoder processing with skip connection storage
        skips = []
        for layer in encoder_layers:
            x = process(x)
            skips.append(x)
        
        # Decoder processing with weighted skip connections
        for i, layer in decoder_layers:
            x = layer(x + skip_weights[i] * skips.pop())
```

3. Optimized Positional Embeddings:
```python
class Rotary:
    def __init__(self):
        # Delay frequency tensor creation to ensure proper device placement
        self.inv_freq = None
        
    def forward(self, x):
        if first_call or length_changed:
            # Create frequencies on same device as input
            self.inv_freq = compute_frequencies(x.device)
            self.cache_embeddings()
```

4. Sequence Processing Improvements:
```python
# Modified data loader for long sequences
class DistributedDataLoader:
    def next_batch(self):
        # Load ultra-long sequences (64k tokens)
        batch = load_sequence(64*1024)
        # Process with sliding window attention
        return windowed_batch(batch, window=1024)
```

Key Algorithmic Impacts:
1. Attention Complexity Reduction: Block sparse attention reduces O(nÂ²) complexity through document/window constraints
2. Memory Efficiency: Dynamic device placement and caching prevent GPU memory fragmentation
3. Gradient Flow Enhancement: Learnable skip weights improve gradient propagation in deep network
4. Long Context Handling: 64k token sequences with windowed attention enable processing of long documents
5. Training Stability: Compiled attention operators and optimized frequency tensors improve throughput
