   - **FlexAttention Implementation:** Replaced standard scaled dot-product attention with PyTorch's flex_attention mechanism supporting 64K context length
   - **Dynamic Block Masking:** Added document-aware causal masking combining:
     - Standard causal attention
     - Document boundary preservation
     - 1024-token sliding window
   - **Sequence Length Expansion:** Increased context length from 1K to 64K tokens
   - **Data Loading Optimization:** Modified DistributedDataLoader to:
     - Better handle long sequences
     - Reduce document splitting
     - Improve shard management
   - **Memory Efficiency:** Implemented block-wise attention computation
   - **Training Optimization:** Adjusted hyperparameters for large context training:
     - Reduced global batch size from 512 to 8
     - Increased per-device sequence length 64x
     - Adjusted iteration counts

2. **Benefits of Changes:**

   - **Context Preservation:** Document-aware masking prevents cross-document attention and preserves complete contexts
   - **Memory Efficiency:** Block-wise attention with multiple constraints reduces memory footprint for long sequences
   - **Training Speed:** Achieved 35% faster training (5.03 vs 7.2 minutes) through:
     - Larger parallel context processing
     - Optimized attention kernels via torch.compile
   - **Data Integrity:** Reduced document splitting improves learning signal quality
   - **Scalability:** FlexAttention foundation enables future context length increases

3. **Performance Contributions:**

   - **Throughput:** 64x longer sequences enable more efficient compute utilization
   - **Convergence:** Larger context windows provide richer learning signals per iteration
   - **Accuracy Tradeoff:** Slight HellaSwag dip (29% vs 30%) offset by:
     - Faster training times
     - Better long-context handling
     - More natural document processing
   - **Memory Management:** Block masking enables training 64K context on same hardware that previously handled 1K

4. **Technical Challenges Addressed:**

   - **Attention Complexity:** Solved O(nÂ²) memory problem through:
     - Sliding window constraints
