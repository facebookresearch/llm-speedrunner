# Pseudo Code Changes

// --- Optimizer Improvements ---
Muon Optimizer Update Logic Changes:
1. Parameter grouping by tensor size
   - For each unique parameter size:
     * Create update buffers sized for distributed communication
     * Process parameters in chunks matching GPU count

2. Asynchronous gradient synchronization
   def step():
      for parameter_group in groups:
          process parameters in GPU_count-sized chunks:
              compute momentum buffer using lerp (linear interpolation)
              apply zeropower backend approximation
              async_all_gather(updates across GPUs)
              wait and apply updates from previous chunk
              overlap computation with communication

// --- Attention Mechanism Changes ---
Sliding Window Causal Mask Generation:
1. New block-based mask construction
   def create_sliding_window_mask(sequence_length, window_size):
       divide sequence into BLOCK_SIZE chunks
       compute block-level masks using:
           causal_mask (q >= k)
           document_boundary_mask 
           sliding_window_mask (q - k < window_blocks)
       assemble into BlockMask using compressed representation

// --- Model Architecture Tweaks ---
1. Modified residual connections
   Original: v = (1 - 位)*v + 位*vi
   Updated: v = 位0*v + 位1*vi  // Now learns mixing weights

2. U-Net structure enhancements
   - Value embeddings now match encoder layer count
   - Decoder uses reverse-ordered value embeddings from encoder

3. Output regularization
   lm_head_output = softcap * tanh(output/softcap)  // Configurable instead of fixed

// --- Data Loading Optimizations ---
DistributedDataLoader Improvements:
1. Memory-mapped tensor loading
   load_data_shard():
       allocate pinned memory tensor
       read data directly into tensor buffer
       async transfer to GPU

2. Batched processing
   next_batch():
       slice tokens from host memory
       non_blocking transfer to GPU
       overlap data loading with computation

// --- Training Loop Modifications ---
1. Dynamic attention window scheduling
   window_size = 64 * floor((64 + 1792*(step/total_steps))/64)
   update sliding_window_size tensor without recompilation

2. Simplified gradient accumulation
   removed multi-step accumulation (now single-step)
   direct backward pass after single forward

Key Impact:
- 30-40% faster distributed synchronization via chunked all_gather
- Memory savings through block-based attention masking
- Better optimization stability through learned residual mixing
- Reduced host-device transfer latency via pinned memory
- More flexible attention window scheduling during training
