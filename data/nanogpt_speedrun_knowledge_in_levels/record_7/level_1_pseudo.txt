# Pseudo Code Changes

1. Muon Optimizer Improvements:
   - Remove distributed training parameters (rank/world_size)
   - Use environment variables directly for parallelization check:
     if i % WORLD_SIZE == RANK: handle parameter distribution
   - Change gradient scaling logic:
     Original: scale by sqrt(max_dimension)
     New: scale by sqrt(max(1, rows/columns)) to handle parameter matrix aspect ratios
   - Enforce gradient existence with assert instead of conditional

2. GPT Model Architecture Changes:
   Add RMS normalization after initial embedding:
     Original: TokenEmbedding -> TransformerBlocks -> FinalNorm
     New: TokenEmbedding -> RMSNorm -> TransformerBlocks -> FinalNorm
   Change weight initialization strategy:
     Disable weight tying between embeddings and classifier head
     Initialize classifier head weights to zero instead

3. Attention Backend Optimization:
   Force use cuDNN for attention computation:
     Disable Flash/math/mem-efficient backends
     Explicitly enable cudnn_sdp backend

4. Optimizer Configuration Split:
   Original: 
     Single AdamW for classifier head
     Muon for transformer layers at 0.1*base_lr
   New: 
     Three separate optimizers:
     - Adam (high lr=0.3) for input embeddings
     - Adam (low lr=0.002) for classifier head
     - Muon (lr=0.02) for transformer layers

5. Training Schedule Adjustments:
   Reduce total iterations from 5100 → 4578
   Adjust warmdown phase from 1450 → 1308 iterations
   Change base learning rate from 3.6e-3 → 0.02 for Muon

Key Algorithmic Impacts:
- Improved numerical stability through matrix aspect ratio-aware scaling
- Enhanced parallelism handling via environment variables
- Potential training acceleration through cudnn attention backend
- Fine-grained optimization strategy with parameter-type specific optimizers
- Modified normalization scheme for better gradient flow
- Adjusted curriculum through revised iteration counts and learning rates

Pseudo Code Structure Overview:

Training Pipeline:
   1. Initialize model with:
      - Extra RMSNorm after embeddings
      - Zero-initialized classifier head
   2. Configure attention backend:
      Set cudnn as primary SDP implementation
   3. Create optimizers:
      For embeddings → High LR Adam
      For classifier → Low LR Adam 
      For transformer → Muon with aspect-ratio scaling
   4. Training loop:
      For each batch:
         Forward pass through modified normalization path
         Backward pass
         Update parameters with respective optimizers:
             Muon applies:
                 - Momentum/Nesterov acceleration
                 - Matrix orthogonalization backend
                 - Aspect-ratio scaled gradient updates
